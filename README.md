# Game of Life
This is a PHP implementation of Conway's Game of Life. 

The code was originally written as a mob programming experiment during Global Day of Coderetreat, November 15, 2014, in Austin, TX
This version has been repackaged to be PSR-0 compliant and structured like a typical PHP library.

To try it out, run the GameOfLife.php script from a bash command prompt.

To run smaller grids, the script will accept command line arguments for width and height:

Example:

./GameOfLife.php 10 30
